// 6. Start with the ARROVER3 program in Chapter 8. Keep the safearay class the same as in
// that program, and, using inheritance, derive the capability for the user to specify both the
// upper and lower bounds of the array in a constructor. This is similar to Exercise 9 in
// Chapter 8, except that inheritance is used to derive a new class (you can call it safehilo)
// instead of modifying the original class.
