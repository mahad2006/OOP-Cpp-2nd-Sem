// 8. Operators in some computer languages, such as Visual Basic, allow you to select parts of
// an existing string and assign them to other strings. (The Standard C++ string class
// offers a different approach.) Using inheritance, add this capability to the Pstring class of
// Exercise 2. In the derived class, Pstring2, incorporate three new functions: left(),
// mid(), and right().
// s2.left(s1, n) // s2 is assigned the leftmost n characters
// // from s1
// s2.mid(s1, s, n) // s2 is assigned the middle n characters
// // from s1, starting at character number s
// // (leftmost character is 0)
// s2.right(s1, n) // s2 is assigned the rightmost n characters
// // from s1
// You can use for loops to copy the appropriate parts of s1, character by character, to a
// temporary Pstring2 object, which is then returned. For extra credit, have these functions
// return by reference, so they can be used on the left side of the equal sign to change parts
// of an existing string
