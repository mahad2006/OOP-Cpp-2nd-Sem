// 9. Start with the publication, book, and tape classes of Exercise 1. Suppose you want to
// add the date of publication for both books and tapes. From the publication class, derive
// a new class called publication2 that includes this member data. Then change book and
// tape so they are derived from publication2 instead of publication. Make all the
// necessary changes in member functions so the user can input and output dates along with
// the other data. For the dates, you can use the date class from Exercise 5 in Chapter 6,
// which stores a date as three ints, for month, day, and year.
