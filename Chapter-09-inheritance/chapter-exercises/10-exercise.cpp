// 10. There is only one kind of manager in the EMPMULT program in this chapter. Any serious
// company has executives as well as managers. From the manager class derive a class
// called executive. (We’ll assume an executive is a high-end kind of manager.) The additional data in the executive class will be the size of the employee’s yearly bonus and the
// number of shares of company stock held in his or her stock-option plan. Add the appropriate
// member functions so these data items can be input and displayed along with the other
// manager data
