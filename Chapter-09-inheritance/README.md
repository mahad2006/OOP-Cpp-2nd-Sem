# Chapter 09 – Inheritance

## Chapter Overview

This chapter focuses on **Inheritance** in C++, a core OOP feature that allows one class (the derived class) to acquire the properties and behaviors of another class (the base class). Inheritance promotes **code reuse**, **extensibility**, and the creation of **hierarchical class structures**.

**Topics Covered:**

- Derived Class and Base Class  
- Derived Class Constructors  
- Overriding Member Functions  
- Which Function Is Used?  
- Inheritance in the English Distance Class  
- Class Hierarchies  
- Inheritance and Graphics Shapes  
- Public and Private Inheritance  
- Levels of Inheritance  
- Multiple Inheritance  
- private Derivation in EMPMULT  
- Ambiguity in Multiple Inheritance  
- Aggregation: Classes Within Classes  
- Inheritance and Program Development

## Purpose of This Chapter Folder

- **chapter-codes/** – Contains topic-wise codes demonstrating various inheritance concepts and implementations.  
- **chapter-exercises/** – Contains solutions to exercises provided at the end of the chapter.

## How to Use

1. Open the `chapter-codes/` folder to study and test example codes for each topic in inheritance.  
2. Open the `chapter-exercises/` folder to practice and reinforce your understanding.  
3. Each code file is **well-commented** for quick revision and clarity.

## Notes

- All codes are based on the examples and structure from the textbook: _Object-Oriented Programming in C++ (4th Edition)_ by Robert Lafore.  
- Focus on understanding **access specifiers**, **constructor behavior**, and **function overriding** in inheritance.  
- Pay attention to **ambiguity issues** in multiple inheritance and techniques to resolve them.
