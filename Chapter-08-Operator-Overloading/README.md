# Chapter 08 – Operator Overloading

## Chapter Overview

This chapter focuses on **operator overloading** in C++, which allows you to redefine the behavior of operators for user-defined types. Operator overloading makes classes more intuitive and easier to use, mimicking the behavior of built-in types.

**Topics Covered:**

- Overloading Unary Operators
- Overloading Binary Operators
- Data Conversion
- UML Class Diagrams
- Pitfalls of Operator Overloading and Conversion
- Keywords: `explicit` and `mutable`

## Purpose of This Chapter Folder

- **chapter-codes/** – Contains topic-wise codes demonstrating operator overloading and data conversion concepts.
- **chapter-exercises/** – Contains solutions to exercises provided at the end of the chapter.

## How to Use

1. Open the `chapter-codes/` folder to study and test example codes for each topic.
2. Open the `chapter-exercises/` folder to practice and verify your understanding.
3. Each code file is properly commented for easier understanding and quick revision.

## Notes

- All codes follow the structure and examples provided in the textbook: _Object-Oriented Programming in C++ (4th Edition)_ by Robert Lafore.
- Carefully observe pitfalls and conversion rules while experimenting with operator overloading.
- Use this folder as a reference for solving problems and for exam preparation.
